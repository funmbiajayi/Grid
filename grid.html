        Your children are not your children. <br>
        They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. <br>
        They come through you but not from you. <br>
        And though they are with you yet they belong not to you. <br>
        You may give them your love but not your thought, <br>
        For they have their own thoughts. <br>
        You may strive to be like them,<br>but seek not to make them like you. <br>
        For life goes not backward<br>nor tarries with yesterday. <br>
